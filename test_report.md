### New AI Tools Build Agents

OpenAI has just unveiled some revolutionary [[new tools for building agents with the API]], transforming how developers can create intelligent systems. Imagine having an AI that not only answers your questions but also interacts with the web, conducts in-depth research, and even automates tasks on your computerall in real time. 

The standout features include a web search tool that instantly pulls current information from the internet, a file search tool that allows for personal data handling, and a computer use tool for automating interactions with applications lacking APIs. This means you can now build a personal assistant that knows your preferences and can complete complex tasks autonomously. 

Developers no longer have to juggle multiple low-level APIs; instead, they can harness a new API designed to handle multi-step workflows efficiently. This evolution in AI tools is set to change how we think about agent capabilities, making 2025 truly the "Year of the Agent."
